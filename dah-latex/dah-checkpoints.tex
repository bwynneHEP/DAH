{\bf Important note}: Please consult the DAH manual to familiarise yourself with the equipment, including the Raspberry Pi, LEDs, temperature sensors, ADCs, DACs, I/O, switches, breadboard and connectors.
The manual contains detailed instructions on how to operate the Raspberry Pi.
The Python code snippets below can also be found on the course github repository, see \url{https://github.com/bwynneHEP/DAH}.
Data sheets for all electronic elements are available from Dropbox, see \url{https://www.dropbox.com/sh/gfnisnh4ntnum1d/AAAWtNL_AhcpR8PZ_QmqZpsja?n=112609310}.  

\section{Checkpoint 1: LEDs and Switches}

\begin{enumerate}
\item [1.1.] Control an LED with the Raspberry Pi by completing the following steps.
Connect the Raspberry Pi to a breadboard using the adapter.
On the breadboard, connect GPIO~24 to an LED with a 1~kOhm resistor in series to ground: this is a ``positive logic'' or ``active high'' circuit, as descibed in the lab manual.

\end{center}

\newpage
Using this code template, import the GPIO library and turn the LED on and off.
\lstinputlisting{../scripts/checkpoint_1a.py}

Repeat the exercise with negative logic (active low) by connecting the LED with a 1~kOhm resistor in series to 3.3~V.
Draw a schematic diagram for this circuit like the example above.
 

\item [1.2.] Modify the first Python script to blink the LED continuously.
You can do this by adding a while loop. \\

\lstinputlisting{../scripts/checkpoint_1b.py}

Since this code will keep running forever, you'll need to press CTRL+C to stop it.
 

\item [1.3.] Using positive logic (active high) connect a push-button switch between 3.3V and GPIO23 and, with a 1~kOhm resistor in series, to ground.
See the diagram in your lab manual for more information.
Modify your Python script to toggle the LED state every time the push button switch is pushed. \\

\section{Checkpoint 2: ADC, DAC and SPI BUS}

Most experimental observables are continuous: their values can vary by arbitrarily small amounts.
However, we record measurements as discrete values: a number with some range of uncertainty.
Creating a numerical (digital) measurement from a continuous (analogue) signal is called digitisation, and is performed by an Analogue to Digital Converter (ADC).
The digital information can then be analysed with a computer.

In this checkpoint we will use an ADC to read information from a light sensor into the Raspberry Pi.
We will also perform the opposite task, varying the brightness of an LED by converting a numerical output from the Raspberry Pi into the corresponding voltage level using a Digital to Analogue Converter (DAC).

\vspace*{-0.5cm}
\begin{enumerate}

\item [2.1.] Connect an ADC MCP3208 chip to the Raspberry Pi using the SPI Interface.
Make sure that all required connections between the MCP3208 and the Raspberry Pi are made (see lab manual).
Use a multimeter to check that power (VDD) and ground (AGND and DGND) are correctly connected.

Connect a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) and a 4.7~k$\Omega$ resistor as a voltage divider between 3.3 and 0~V, using an ADC input channel to measure the voltage in the middle.
Use Python to read the voltages of all eight ADC channels.
Try reading a specific ADC channel, and experiment with all the other methods given below.
%You are encouraged to consult the following webpage \url{http://webiopi.trouch.com/}($\rightarrow$ Tutorials $\rightarrow$ Using Devices $\rightarrow$ Analog).
Remember the built-in Python method \texttt{help( someCode )} which can give you information about the code.

\lstinputlisting{../scripts/checkpoint_2a.py}
\vspace*{-0.5cm}

\newpage
\item [2.2.] Leave the ADC in place, but also connect the DAC MCP4922 chip to the Raspberry Pi.
Make sure that all required connections between the MCP4922 and the Raspberry Pi are made (see lab manual).
Use a multimeter to check that power (VDD) and ground (VSS) are correctly connected.

Use Python to set a value --- e.g. 1.3~V --- to output VOUTA of the DAC.
Measure this voltage with a multimeter. \\

\lstinputlisting{../scripts/checkpoint_2b.py}
%\vspace*{-0.5cm}

\item [2.3.] Connect one output of the DAC to an LED.
Write a Python script that varies the brightness of the LED by setting a series of different values for the output voltage of the DAC.
Now arrange the circuit so that the LED is next to the LDR, and the change in brightness can be measured.
The laboratory is quite bright relative to an LED, so you might need to cover the breadboard to show a convincing change.
Modify your script to read the ADC input each time you set the DAC output.
Write the DAC setting and measured ADC values at each step to an output file with comments such that the content of the file will explain your work.

\end{enumerate}

{\bf NB:} Do not dismantle your circuit after this checkpoint!
You can re-use most of it for Checkpoint~3.

\section{Checkpoint 3: Sampling Analogue Signals}

\begin{enumerate}

\item [3.1.] Connect an ADC chip (MCP3208) to the Raspberry Pi, as in Checkpoint 2 (or re-use your existing circuit).

Use the bench-top signal generator to produce a repetitive signal, e.g. a sinusoidal waveform.
Display the output on the oscilloscope.
Set the amplitude of the signal such that the waveform can be read by the ADC chip, which can sample between 0~V and VREF = 3.3~V. Set the frequency to 10~Hz.

Connect the output of the signal generator to an ADC input channel.
Don't connect a signal with a voltage outside the range of the ADC chip: this could destroy it (and the Raspberry Pi)!
Use Python to read a few measurements from the ADC, and make sure they behave as you expect.

\item [3.2.] Measure the waveform produced by the signal generator by writing a Python script that records 100 ADC samples and displays these on a graph of voltage vs time.
Calculate the approximate time between samples by measuring the start and end times of your sampling and dividing the difference by 100.
You can use the pylab interface for plotting graphs --- example files are available on GitHub.
Always label plots correctly with title and axes and save these to a file (pdf format).

\item [3.3.] Given the time that you calculated elapses between ADC samples, what is the highest input signal frequency that you can expect to measure correctly?
(You may wish to research signal sampling a little before jumping to your answer...)
Test input signals at a range of different frequencies to see if the results are as you expect.

\item [3.4.] Calibrate the voltage scale of the ADC output with respect to the voltage scale displayed on the oscilloscope by using a square waveform that closely matches the ADC input range.
First connect the signal from the signal generator to the oscilloscope.
Read the input voltage for the high and low sections of the square waveform from the oscilloscope screen.
For this use the trigger threshold dial to determine these voltage levels as precisely as possible.
Then connect the signal to an ADC input channel.
Write a Python script that takes 100 ADC samples and finds the average voltages for the high and low sections of the square waveform separately.
Reduce the amplitude of the input waveform by a factor of about two and repeat above procedure.
Plot the four calibration measurements, i.e. the measured ADC voltages versus the four input voltages (measured with the oscilloscope) on a graph.

%\item[3.4.]	What is the maximum signal frequency with which you can properly record a given repetitive signal?   First, consider which would be the best waveform for this investigation. What is the sampling frequency? Explain what happens when a signal is undersampled. Make a plot with a waveform that is undersampled.   

%\hfill [2 marks] \\

%\item [3.5.] Connect a DAC chip (MCP4922) to the Raspberry Pi, as in Checkpoint 2.  Using a Python script, generate a sinusoidal waveform on the DAC output and plot the waveform to a graph.

%Use the ADC chip (MCP3208) to digitise the waveform generated by the DAC. Write a Python script that takes 100 DAC samples and 100 ADC measurements and plot these on the same graph. Take into account the limitations encountered in 3.4.

\section{Checkpoint 4: Input/Output and I2C BUS}

\begin{enumerate}


\item [4.1.] Input/Output (I/O) Expander chips enable the user to connect many devices that have the same or similar functions.
With the Raspberry Pi this can be achieved using the I2C bus.
Connect the PCF8574AN chip  (I2C BUS Expander) to the Raspberry Pi.
Make sure that all required connections between the PCF8574AN chip and the Raspberry Pi are made, as shown in the lab manual.

Using negative logic connect an LED to output P0 of the PCF8574AN Expander chip. 
Write a Python script to blink the LED, similar to what you did in Checkpoint 1.

%You may consult the \webiopi webpage \url{http://webiopi.trouch.com/} ($\rightarrow$ Tutorials $\rightarrow$ Using Devices $\rightarrow$ Digital) to find information on the GPIO expander chip.

%{\bf NB:} The GPIO library used here is different to that used in Checkpoint 1.
%The RPi.GPIO definitions are not compatible with the \webiopi I/O expander commands. \\

\lstinputlisting{../scripts/checkpoint_4a.py}

\item [4.2.] Connect an additional 3 LEDs to outputs P1, P2 and P3 of the PCF8574AN Expander chip.
Write a Python script which turns the LEDs on and off in a defined pattern, using the \texttt{portWrite} method to control all four LEDs at the same time.
Experiment with \texttt{portWrite} --- it takes a numerical value as its argument.
Make sure you understand how the value you give to it affects the LEDs.

%\newpage
%\item [4.3.] Consult the webpage \url{http://webiopi.trouch.com/} ($\rightarrow$ Tutorials $\rightarrow$ Using Devices $\rightarrow$ Digital) for the GPIO Expander. Use the portWrite(value) method to manipulate all four LEDs at the same time.  Connect a push button switch to pin P4 of the expander chip. Write a Python script such that an LED pattern toggles every time the button is pushed.\\

\item [4.3.] Connect a push button switch to pin P7 of the expander chip.
Modify your Python script so that the button can be used to change the LED pattern.
Each press of the button should change the pattern, without requiring that the button be held down.

\end{enumerate}
\hfill {\bf[3~marks]}

\item Submit your code where you use the \texttt{portWrite} command to display multiple different patterns with four LEDs.

\null\hfill {\bf[1~mark]}

\end{itemize}


\newpage
\section{Checkpoint 5: Temperature Sensors}

\begin{enumerate}

\item [5.1.] We will be using DS18B20 temperature sensors for this checkpoint.
Take a look at the datasheet here: \url{http://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/DS18B20.pdf} or download it from the DAH Dropbox.

Connect a DS18B20 temperature sensor to your Raspberry Pi (look at the flat front of the sensor to get it the right way around):
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=14cm]{figs/DS182B0}
\end{center}
{\bf NB:} If your sensor gets very hot you have connected it backwards! Disconnect it immediately.

%What is the interface between the DS18B20 temperature sensor and the Raspberry Pi? Explain how it works. 

%Install the drivers for the sensor on the Raspberry Pi with the following commands:
%    pi@Demonstrator-pi ~ $   sudo modprobe w1-gpio
%    pi@Demonstrator-pi ~ $   sudo modprobe w1-therm
%
%Note that you will need to do this again if you restart the Raspberry Pi.

Locate the sensor output by finding the file that has the serial number of your sensor:
\begin{verbatim} 
    studentnn@dahpimm ~ $  cd /sys/bus/w1/devices 
    studentnn@dahpimm /sys/bus/w1/devices $ ls 
    10-00080265b6d6 w1_bus_master1 
\end{verbatim}
%Your temperature sensor will be called something similar to 10-00080265b6d6, but is just an example.

%Now read the sensor output, i.e. the raw temperature measurement:
%\begin{verbatim}
%    studentnn@dahpimm /sys/bus/w1/devices ~ $ cd 10-00080265b6d6
%    studentnn@dahpimm /sys/bus/w1/devices/10-00080265b6d6 $ cat w1_*
%    30 00 4b 46 ff ff 0d 10 29 : crc=29 YES 
%    30 00 4b 46 ff ff 0d 10 29 t=23937 
%\end{verbatim}
%This should be interpreted as $23.937^{\circ}$C.

%\newpage
%WebIOPi provides a simple way to access the temperature sensor data in Python.

Your temperature sensor will be called something similar to \texttt{10-00080265b6d6}, but this is just an example.
You can read the temperature sensor data in Python like this, using the serial number you found for your sensor.
\lstinputlisting{../scripts/checkpoint_5a.py}

Test this method yourself, with a loop taking temperature measurements and displaying them on the screen.

%\hfill [2 marks]


\item[5.2.] Measure temperature with the DS18B20 sensor versus time.
Choose a sensible time interval, and note that taking a single temperature measurement is quite slow.
Write a Python script to make a graph of 50 temperature measurements versus time.
Always label plots correctly with title and axes and save these to a file.
 
%As a second step the graph should update itself as each temperature measurement is made.
%Write a Python script for this purpose.
%Once this is working, play with it by touching the temperature sensor with your fingers.
%Describe what is happening and sketch it in your lab book.

Sitting watching a blank screen is boring.
The following code example shows how to display a plot that updates as new data is recorded over time, if you want to try it:
\lstinputlisting{../scripts/checkpoint_5b.py}
%\hfill [3 marks]



\item[5.3.]	Add another temperature sensor to your circuit by connecting it in parallel with the existing one. 
You don't need to make separate connections to the Raspberry Pi: your new sensor can sit in the same breadboard tracks as the existing one (just make sure that you connect it the right way around).

Find its serial number in the \texttt{w1/devices} folder like before.
Now ensure that you can read out your two temperature sensors simultaneously in Python.

%You can test this by running Python in interactive mode first. 
%Note that your temperature sensors will have different serial numbers.
%
%\begin{verbatim}
%    studentnn@dahpimm  ~ $ python3
%\end{verbatim}
%\lstinputlisting{../scripts/checkpoint_5c.py}
%
%What is the smallest change in temperature that a sensor can report? Explain this with reference to the datasheet, and how the temperature information is encoded.
%
Investigate the accuracy of the sensor readings by looking at the stability of the measurement with time, and by comparing the outputs of your two sensors.
You can probably assume that the ambient temperature in the lab is constant, but shielding your sensors from breezes may help.

\newpage

Modify your graphing code from part 5.2 to make histograms of the temperature measurements of the two sensors.
Plot data from each sensor as separate histograms on a shared set of axes.
You can use the pylab histogram command:
\lstinputlisting{../scripts/checkpoint_5d.py}
%Make also a graph of the difference between the temperature of the two sensors. Determine the RMS value of a set of temperature difference measurements between the two sensors. Explain your results. Are these consistent with the datasheet?

%\hfill [3 marks]

%Modify your graphing code from part 5.2 to display data from both temperature sensors on a single graph.
Take a set of temperature measurements from both sensors reading the (hopefully) constant background temperature in the lab, and calculate the mean and standard deviation for each sensor separately.

\section{Checkpoint 6: Data Handling and Analysis}

\begin{enumerate}

\item [6.1.] This is a data handling exercise and the Raspberry Pi is not required, but can still be used.
You may find it faster to use the CPlab computers --- there are several available in the DAH laboratory.
Alternatively you could use a personal laptop.
You will need the following Python libraries:
\lstinputlisting{../scripts/checkpoint_6a.py}

The LHCb experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN has recorded a sample of muon pairs with invariant masses in the range of 8.5 to 11 GeV/$c^2$.
Three clear peaks are observed in this mass spectrum.
These correspond to the production of Upsilon mesons, which are bound states of a $b$ and a anti-$b$ quark.
These states are known as the $\Upsilon \rm (1S)$, $\Upsilon \rm (2S)$ and $\Upsilon \rm (3S)$ mesons where the $\Upsilon \rm (1S)$ meson is the ground state and the $\Upsilon \rm (2S)$  and $\Upsilon \rm (3S)$ states are radial excitations (for LHCb paper, see \href{https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP06(2013)064}{DOI: 10.1007/JHEP06(2013)064}).

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=9cm]{figs/mu-pair-mass}
\end{center}

Download the file upsilons-mass-xaa.txt from the DAH Dropbox, which contains the invariant masses of a large number of muon pairs in units of GeV/$c^2$ in text format. 
Write a python script that reads the data from this file and plots a histogram of all the masses, choosing a reasonable bin width.
Always label plots correctly with title and axes and save these to a file.
[Hint: The bin width should be chosen such that each of the three peaks is clearly resolved and represented by a sufficient number of bins for analysis.]

%\hfill [2 marks]

\item [6.2.] Determine the masses of the three particles by determining the bins with the highest number of entries in the peak regions.
Divide the histogram into three peak regions and write a local peak finding method for this part.
%What are the mass differences between the $\Upsilon \rm (2S)$ and $\Upsilon \rm (3S)$ states with respect to the $\Upsilon \rm (1S)$ meson? %By inspecting visually the muon-pair mass
%spectrum, determine the Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) of the $\Upsilon \rm (1S)$ mass peak.

%\hfill [2 marks]


\item [6.3.] Determine the mass of the $\Upsilon \rm (1S)$ meson and its uncertainty.
This can be achieved by several methods.
First by looking at the mass spectrum, choose a suitable region around the $\Upsilon \rm (1S)$ mass peak.
Calculate the mean, the unbiased variance and standard deviation for the events in this region.
Use these values to determine the standard deviation of the mean.
Comment on possible biases for this method.

The mass peaks corresponding to the three $\Upsilon$ mesons can be described reasonably well by a Gaussian function,
$f(x) = \frac{S}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} \exp{\left( -\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right)}$
where $x$ is the invariant mass of the muon pairs, $\mu$ is the mass of the $\Upsilon \rm (1S)$ meson, $\sigma$ is the Gaussian width (mass resolution) and $S$ is the total number of signal events. 
By inspecting visually the muon-pair mass histogram, determine the Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) of the $\Upsilon \rm (1S)$ mass peak.
Assuming a Gaussian signal shape estimate the mass resolution $\sigma$ from the FWHM. %of the $\Upsilon \rm (1S)$  peak. 
Compare this result for the mass resolution of the $\Upsilon \rm (1S)$ peak with the standard deviation determined above and comment.

Compare your mass measurement with the Particle Data Group (\href{https://pdg.lbl.gov/}{pdg.lbl.gov}) and comment.
[Hint: The PDG lists the properties of particles. Select ``pdgLive - Interactive Listings'' followed by ``Mesons b anti-b'' to find the $\Upsilon \rm (1S)$ meson.]

%\hfill [3 marks]\\


\item [6.4.] In the muon-pair mass spectrum define a signal region of width $\pm 150\; {\rm MeV}/c^2$ around the $\Upsilon \rm (1S)$ peak position and determine the number of events $N$ in this region.
Define an upper and lower sideband region where there are only background events.
These sidebands should each be half as wide as the signal region and located at masses equidistant from the $\Upsilon \rm (1S)$ peak position.
Assuming that the background is falling linearly with the muon-pair mass, determine the number of background events $B$ in the signal region (below the $\Upsilon \rm (1S)$ mass peak).
Perform either a linear least squares fit in the sideband regions or use the sideband subtraction method (from the lectures) for this.
Determine the number of signal events $S$ in the signal region.

%Alternatively, if you know how to perform a fit you may choose fitting the $\Upsilon \rm (1S)$   peak in the mass spectrum for this part.

% Assuming Gaussian statistics for N and using the mass resolution ? determine the statistical error %on the mass of the ?(1S) meson. 

%\hfill [3 marks]

%6.4. Download the file upsilons-mass-pt-xaa.txt from the DAH Dropbox which, in addition to the masses, also contains the transverse momenta pT of the muon- pairs in units of GeV/c in text format. For an explanation of the transverse momentum, see the LHCb paper, referred to above. Write a python script that reads in these data and plot a histogram of the transverse momenta for all events. Plot a 2-dimensional histogram of pT versus mass for all events, choosing 50 bins in pT and 100 bins in mass.
